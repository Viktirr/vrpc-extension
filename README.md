#VRPC-EXTENSION

Extension portion of the VRPC application.  

While it's not available yet on any browser, you may enable the extension manually by going to
`about:debugging`
in your browser and selecting manifest.json from there.  

Please note that there are many development features/residuals left here, as well as on the app. However, the extension and app is usable. THIS IS AN UNFINISHED PRODUCT, YOU ARE TAKING PART OF AN EARLY VERSION OF THE PRODUCT.  

While the majority of this app and extension is done, please note that it is still a work in progress.
